          <h5>Geography BSc (Hons)</h5>
          <p>Geography was my strongest subject at school, and the one I enjoyed most, so I decided to continue it onto degree level. I had a fantastic time in Plymouth and created many fond memories as well as some great friendships. Those three years went very quickly. It allowed me to specialise in the parts of geography that I really enjoyed - primarily Climate change, Geohazards and Fluvial geomorphology. It also gave me valuable skills including: GIS and cartography, organising and conducting experiments to achieve a research goal and improving my presentational style. I was also lucky enough to work with some great lecturers during my time there, the most famous being <a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/iain-stewart/8/350/549">Dr Iain Stewart</a>.</p>

          <h5>Geological and Environmental Hazards MSc</h5>
          <p>I order to specialise further and improve my employability in a competitive job market, I decided to study towards a masters degree. Portsmouth is one of the best places in the country to study geohazards. It taught me geological and geotechnical skills, helping me identify areas at risk and map potential hazards, as well as measures that can be undertaken to mitigate future risk. I especially enjoyed the geohazard risk assessment module where we got to present our group finding of flood risk to The Environment Agency. I also enjoyed the field trips that were part of the course, which gave me an insite into how the skills  I had learnt in the classroom were applicable in the field.</p>

          <p>Modules:</p>
          <ul>
            <li> Geohazard Data Modelling</li>
            <li> Geohazard Risk Analysis</li>
            <li> Rock and Soil Mechanics</li>
            <li> Volcanology and Seismology</li>
            <li> Spatial data Acquisition and Analysis</li>
            <li> Landslide hazard analysis</li>
            <li> Geohazard management and remediation</li>
            <li>GIS</li>
          </ul> 
          <p>Fieldwork: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A 5-day residential to Broadway in the Cotswolds, identifying underlying geology, mapping previous landslide features and analysing the capacity for future movement across the escarpment.</li>
            <li>A 10-day residential to Crete and Santorini in Greece looking at the impact of historic seismology and volcanology in the region. We also attended the International forum on satellite earth observational for geohazard risk management. This allowed us to network with experts in our field. </li>

          <h5>Advanced Web Design (Summer Term)</h5>
          <p>Having not found a career relating to my full time education, I was still working in retail. To keep my mind active while I was job searching in signed up for a few night courses. This is where I discovered a passion for coding - especially html and css. I did alot of reading around the course and established a great friendship with the teacher. Following on from the basic dreamweaver course, I continued along the web route and signed up for advanced web design which touched on subjects like responsive and adaptive web design, as well as plugins and good web practices.  </p></div>

          <h4>2013 - Current Treehouse</h4>
          <p>Keen to continue learning, I signed up for Treehouse. The style of teaching is laid back but really informative. The content is new and continually revised with new technologies being released all the time. Your progress is rewarded with badges. Every so often you unlock the next video in a fictitious story about how Treehouse began as a result of the lullaby corporation. Its a really great way of learning to code and they cover so many topics: from HTML to PHP, Ruby to Business. And if you get stuck there is a great forum and Treehouse are great on twitter. Overall I couldn't recommend it more. </p>

          <h4>London 2012 Olympic Games Accreditation</h4>
          <p>This is probably the best thing I have done to date and one of the things  I am most proud of. Against the advice of friends and family, I gave up 3 weeks of my time to be part of the biggest sporting events in the world, the London 2012 Olympic Games. 
          <br>
          After a lengthy application process I secured an interview held at the sailing academy in Weymouth. It was sponsored by cadbury so at every turn there were barrels of heroes, and there was a 'history of the olympics' before the interview. So I was interviewed at one of the first locations they did around the country so it was another few months before I discovered I had been successful. I was going to be part of the accreditation team at Heathrow Airport, processing the Games Family as they entered the UK in the lead up to the games.
          <br>
          My next encounter was when I went to collect my Gamesmaker uniform in London. It was only then that I really felt the magic that surrounded the games.
          I travelled up to London a few more times to participate in training (both on and offsite) and had to complete various security checks to allow me backstage access to Heathrow Airport, this gave me the opportunity to meet some of the people I would be working with. 
          <br>
          I had a fantastic time in the lead up to the games. I was primarily based in terminal 5 but had a shift in terminal 1. I worked alongside a great bunch of people, each with their own experiences and stories to tell. And it was great fun with a fantastic atmosphere. I got to meet lots of athletes from all over the world in various sporting disciplines, games officials and judges as well as senior sporting executives. We worked as a team when we came up against difficulties, such as language barriers, to ensure that the 'client' had a great and welcoming experience to the games and knew where to go after completing their accreditation. What made it special was to see people I had accredited compete and to go on a win medals. An example of this was Pavol Hochschorner who went on to win bronze in the canoe slalom. <br>
          It was a fantastic opportunity and an experience I will never forget.</p></div>

          <h4>University of Plymouth Archery Club</h4>
            <h5>2009 - 2010 Club Social Secretary</h5>
          <p>In my first year at Plymouth university I joined the university archery club as it was a great opportunity to meet new people, do an interesting sport and I was promised that it would be a cheap sport. Within three years I had invested alot of money in equipment and really loved it.<br> In my second year I was elected to be social secretary. The club already had a weekly social visiting local pubs, enjoyed by many of the new and older members alike. I introduced occasional clubbing socials at various venues, where I liaised with party planners to create fantastic nights out. By broadening the clubs social activities we managed to retain more new members for the club.</p>
            <h5>2010 - 2011 Club Secretary</h5>
          <p>In my final year at university I was elected as club secretary, making me legally responsible in the eyes of the national and regional archery bodies. It was a fantastic year because the committee (formed of a group of close friends) all had a single vision, to focus on all aspects of archery - from technique to etticate, to raise the profile of the club regionally and  nationally, and leave a legacy so this could be continued by future committees. We recognised we had talent within the club and utilised this to teach new members better, and broaden the skills of existing members. I was a member of the Plymouth Archery club which increased the clubs connections locally, allowing members to shoot outside of the university club if they wished. We were also successful at gaining a grant from Sports England, allowing us to purchase equipment and rent a larger space and in turn expand the number of members. We participated in regional and national competitions allowing us to develop connections (and friendships) with other university teams.</p></div>

          <h4>2011 University of Plymouth Archery Club and Sport England Funding</h4>
          <p>As part of our shared vision to increase the number of members and raise the profile of the club, we recognised that the club lacked the equipment and space in order to teach more people and facilitate a safe shooting session, where everyone would get chance to participate. Between the committee, we researched viable options to solve this. I suggested that we could apply for funding to enable to a facilitate the growth financially. The committee deemed it a good idea and allowed me to lead the application bid. Working alongside Chris Williams(Club Chairman) and Elliot Moss(Equipment Officer) and the Student Union. We put together a bid for &pound;10,000 as part of the small grants scheme from Sport England. </p>
          <p>We were successful in the bid and were granted &pound;8,146 to be spent on new equipment for the club. It was a fantastic result and something we were immensely proud of. It was the first time a Plymouth University Sporting club had secured outside funding from a large sporting body. With this grant, and alongside other activities in the club, we achieved our goal to raise the profile of the club. We increased the number of members from around 60 to around 100 and retained a large number of these members for the year. We performed better at competitions and allowed members to try new experiences that we could not have offered before (e.g Compound archery). We left a great legacy for future committees to implement and the equipment and facilities to help them continue to provide a fantastic experience for members.</p></div>

          <p>My working background is in retail and mostly within M&amp;S but spread over various departments: from Cafe to General merchandise, Foods to Operations. I started during sixth form and was lucky enough to be able to work around university commitments, working seasonally and during my summer breaks. This continued until 2010, when the store overspent on their christmas staff and I was asked to finish my contract(2 days) at another store locally, where my knowledge within General Merchandise(GM) and in the Customer service desk lead me to being given management rights to deal with sale items and returns. That summer I worked in the Produce section Sainsbury's allowing me to experience another aspect of retail. I worked in various departments including tills and the night crew and really enjoyed the fast pace of it, especially during peak christmas periods.
          I then worked at a M&amp;S Simply Foods store in Westbourne for the summer and this showed me another aspect of retail, specifically centred around a small food store. I continued to work for M&amp;S when I moved to Portsmouth for my Masters degree. I was employed to help out with a refit that was planned in store. My contract was extended to work in (but not exclusively) the foods department, but I regularly worked in GM and the Cafe.
          On completion of my Masters course I moved back to Bournemouth and returned to a post within the cafe of M&amp;S Bournemouth, moving to Operations to allow me to cut my hours so I could pursue a career in web design/development.  </p>
